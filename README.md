# Generate password
This code generates a random password of a specified length by combining lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The user is prompted to enter the desired length for the password, and the script uses the random module to select and shuffle a combination of characters from a predefined list to create the password. The password is then printed to the console.
